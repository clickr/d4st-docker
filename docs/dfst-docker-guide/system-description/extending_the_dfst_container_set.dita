 <title>Extending the DFST Container Set</title>
 <shortdesc>You can use the DFST containers and Composer script as a basis for creating your own
    containers tailored to your own needs</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Docker containers use a layered architecture to build up the components of a container. This
      makes it easy to use an existing container as a base for creating new containers. All of the
      DFST containers are available from the Docker Hub.</p>
    <p>Reasons to make your own containers include:<ul id="ul_epp_wld_55">
        <li>Pre-define the set of git repositories set up under GitLab</li>
        <li>Pre-define some or all of the GitLab configuration: users and groups, authenticatoin
          policies, git hooks, etc.</li>
        <li>Pre-define the GitLab continuous integration jobs</li>
        <li>Set up your own Open Toolkit configuration with your custom plugins.</li>
        <li>Control the network configuration details of the containers</li>
        <li>Manage the containers in a private container repository</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The DFST containers are defined and managed in GitHub in the DFST <xref
        keyref="website-dfst-github-containers-project">docker containers project</xref>.</p>
