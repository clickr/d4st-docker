GitLab CI Job Configuration Files
=================================

GitLab CI jobs are configured through YAML files that are
committed in the root of projects to be built. 

See the GitLab CI documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ci/

Within a given repository the YAML file must be named ".gitlab-ci.yml"

The files here are named in a way that reflects their purpose. To
use one, copy it into your git repository and rename it to ".gitlab-ci.yml".
